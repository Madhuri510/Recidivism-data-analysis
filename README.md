# Recidivism-data-analysis

**Project Title:** "A Deep Dive into Georgia’s Recidivism".

**Project Description:** A one-line summary of the project.

**Objective:** This project aims to explore the complexities of recidivism in Georgia’s criminal justice system by analyzing data from 2013–2015. Through a combination of data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and predictive modeling, the research identifies key demographic, behavioral, and systemic factors influencing the likelihood of reoffending within three years of release. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques and tools like PySpark, Databricks, and Spark MLlib, the project provides actionable insights to guide targeted interventions and enhance rehabilitation strategies, contributing to a more effective and data-driven criminal justice system.
